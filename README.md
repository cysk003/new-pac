# Project Overview

Welcome to my repository! This project is actively maintained, and I am continuously adding new features and improving performance. The repository contains various scripts, configuration files, and tools aimed at making software development more efficient and robust.

## Features

- **Bash Scripts**: Automate tasks such as server setup, network configurations, and system optimizations.
- **C Programming**: Low-level programming for network services and performance improvements.
- **Nginx Configurations**: Optimized configurations for high-performance web servers.
- **Proxy Tools**: Includes scripts for configuring and managing proxy servers like SSR, V2Ray, and Trojan.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive instructions for setting up and using the tools in this repository.
